There are some existing programs that keep data on what menu items are the most popular, 
but these are mainly with cafes and non buffet style restaurants. My program will implement some of the ideas and code from existing programs, 
but also give another option for how buffets and universities could reduce their food waste and price of food. I have one main idea which could help 
improve as of now that I want to make into pseudocode, which include: making a system that puts a device, 
basically just a scale, and connects it into a computer to eventually records weight changes of food and stamps a time throughout the day to it.
